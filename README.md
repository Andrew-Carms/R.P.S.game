# This will be a programmed-game of "rock, paper, scissors" where  
# two people will play from two separate computers.
# As the game is played each person will have a chance to click one button

There will be a main menu screen where it says "Play" and
on the next page there will be a slot saying "Name: " where a 'gamertag' name will be inserted
and below the 'name' slot will be a Button saying "Done"
and the next page will have two buttons...
"One Player" and "Two Player"
and when clicked "One Player", it will be against an AI
and when clicked "Two Player", it will send you to a screen 
containing two buttons: "Create Game" and "Join Game"....
"Create Game" will send you to a screen where you wait for someone to join your created game
"Join Game" will send you to a screen with slots where the game is finding nearby created game
and once someone is spotted they will be in a "rock paper scissors" match.
While the game is occurring, 
Each person chooses their option and it keeps score of how many wins, ties, and losses of the users 
until one of the users clicks the "Exit" button.
And the game will take you back to the
"One Player" and "Two Player" menu screen.
